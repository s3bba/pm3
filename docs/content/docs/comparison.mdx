pm3 occupies a specific niche: a **developer-focused, single-binary process manager** with a modern config format. Here's how it compares to popular alternatives.

## pm3 vs pm2

[pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is a popular Node.js process manager.

| | pm3 | pm2 |
|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Single Rust binary | Requires Node.js |
| **Config format** | TOML | JSON/YAML/JS |
| **Language focus** | Language-agnostic | Node.js-centric |
| **Health checks** | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP | Custom module |
| **Zero-downtime reload** | Built-in (blue-green) | Requires cluster mode |
| **Process dependencies** | Built-in (`depends_on`) | Not supported |
| **Lifecycle hooks** | Pre-start, post-stop | Not built-in |
| **Cron restarts** | Built-in | Custom module |
| **Log rotation** | Built-in | Requires pm2-logrotate |
| **File watching** | Built-in | Built-in |
| **Memory limits** | Built-in | Built-in |
| **Cluster mode** | Not supported | Built-in (Node.js) |
| **Install size** | ~10MB binary | ~50MB+ (Node.js + npm) |

**Choose pm3 if** you want a lightweight, language-agnostic process manager without a Node.js dependency.

## pm3 vs foreman / overmind

[foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) and [overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind) use Procfile-based configuration.

| | pm3 | foreman / overmind |
|---|---|---|
| **Config format** | TOML (rich) | Procfile (minimal) |
| **Health checks** | Built-in | Not supported |
| **File watching** | Built-in | Not supported |
| **Memory limits** | Built-in | Not supported |
| **Dependencies** | `depends_on` ordering | Not supported |
| **Daemon mode** | Background daemon | Foreground only |
| **Restart policies** | Configurable | Basic |
| **Boot persistence** | `pm3 startup` | External setup |

**Choose pm3 if** you need health checks, restart policies, or daemon mode. Choose foreman/overmind for simple foreground process running.

## pm3 vs docker-compose

[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) manages containerized services.

| | pm3 | docker-compose |
|---|---|---|
| **Isolation** | OS processes | Docker containers |
| **Config format** | TOML | YAML |
| **Setup overhead** | Install one binary | Install Docker |
| **Startup speed** | Instant | Container pull/build |
| **Resource usage** | Native processes | Container overhead |
| **Networking** | Host networking | Virtual networking |
| **Health checks** | Built-in | Built-in |
| **Dependencies** | `depends_on` | `depends_on` |

**Choose pm3 if** you want to run processes directly without containers — especially for local development. Choose docker-compose for production deployments or when you need container isolation.

## pm3 vs supervisord

[supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) is a traditional Unix process control system.

| | pm3 | supervisord |
|---|---|---|
| **Runtime** | Single Rust binary | Requires Python |
| **Config format** | TOML | INI |
| **TUI** | Built-in | Not built-in |
| **Health checks** | HTTP, HTTPS, TCP | Not built-in |
| **File watching** | Built-in | Not built-in |
| **Memory limits** | Built-in | Not built-in |
| **Cross-platform** | macOS, Linux, Windows | Unix only |
| **Cron restarts** | Built-in | Not built-in |

**Choose pm3 if** you want a modern alternative with more features and no Python dependency.

## Summary

pm3's differentiators:

- **Single binary** — no runtime dependencies (Node.js, Python, Docker).
- **TOML config** — expressive but simple, with per-process options.
- **Built-in TUI** — real-time monitoring without external tools.
- **Batteries included** — health checks, file watching, memory limits, cron restarts, and environment-specific config all built in.
- **Cross-platform** — macOS, Linux, and Windows from the same binary.
