pm3 ships a [Claude Code skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills) that teaches Claude how to generate, edit, and troubleshoot `pm3.toml` configuration files for your project.

## Install

Create the skill file in your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/pm3
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frectonz/pm3/main/.claude/skills/pm3/SKILL.md -o .claude/skills/pm3/SKILL.md
```

Or install it globally so it's available in every project:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/pm3
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frectonz/pm3/main/.claude/skills/pm3/SKILL.md -o ~/.claude/skills/pm3/SKILL.md
```

## Usage

Once installed, invoke the skill in Claude Code with:

```
/pm3
```

Claude will scan your project for existing configuration files (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc.), infer what processes you need, and generate a valid `pm3.toml`.

### Examples

**Generate a config from scratch:**

```
/pm3 set up pm3 for this project
```

**Add a new process:**

```
/pm3 add a redis worker process
```

**Add health checks:**

```
/pm3 add health checks to all my http services
```

**Set up environments:**

```
/pm3 add production and staging environments
```

## What the Skill Knows

The skill has the full pm3 configuration schema baked in, including:

- All process options (`command`, `cwd`, `env`, `restart`, `health_check`, etc.)
- Environment-specific overrides (`[process.env_production]`)
- Validation rules (required fields, naming constraints)
- CLI commands for reference

It will always produce valid TOML that conforms to the pm3 config format.
