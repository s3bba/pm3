pm3 includes a full-featured terminal user interface (TUI) for monitoring and managing your processes in real-time.

```bash
pm3 tui
```

## Views

The TUI has two views: **Process List** and **Log Viewer**.

### Process List

The main view shows a table of all processes with real-time status updates. The header shows connection status and process counts by state.

### Log Viewer

Press `Enter` on a process to open its log viewer. Logs stream in real-time with tab-switching between stdout and stderr.

## Status Colors

| Color | Status |
|---|---|
| Green | Online — process is healthy and running |
| Yellow | Starting — process launched, waiting for health check |
| Red | Unhealthy / Errored — health check failed or process crashed |
| Gray | Stopped — process is not running |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

## Responsive Layout

The TUI adapts to your terminal width:

- **Wide** (100+ columns): Shows all columns (NAME, PID, STATUS, UPTIME, RESTARTS, CPU, MEM).
- **Medium** (70+ columns): Hides CPU% and MEM columns.
- **Narrow** (< 70 columns): Shows only NAME, STATUS, and UPTIME.

## When to Use TUI vs CLI

| Use TUI when... | Use CLI when... |
|---|---|
| Monitoring multiple processes at once | Running a quick one-off command |
| Watching logs in real-time | Scripting or automating with `--json` |
| Interactive start/stop/restart | CI/CD pipelines |
| Debugging startup issues | Remote/headless servers |

The TUI refreshes every second and maintains a live connection to the pm3 daemon.
