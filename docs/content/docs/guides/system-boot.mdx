pm3 can persist your process list and install a system service so your processes start automatically when you boot your machine.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Start your processes
pm3 start

# 2. Save the current process list
pm3 save

# 3. Install the boot service
pm3 startup
```

That's it. Your processes will now start automatically on boot.

## How It Works

### `pm3 save`

Saves the current process list (names, config file path) to disk. This is the snapshot that `pm3 resurrect` will restore.

```bash
pm3 save
```

Run `pm3 save` again whenever you change your `pm3.toml` to update the saved state.

### `pm3 startup`

Installs a system service that runs `pm3 resurrect` on boot.

```bash
pm3 startup
```

#### macOS

On macOS, `pm3 startup` creates a **LaunchAgent** (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/`). This runs under your user account and starts when you log in.

#### Linux

On Linux, `pm3 startup` creates a **systemd user service** (`~/.config/systemd/user/`). This runs under your user account and starts on boot (with lingering enabled).

### `pm3 resurrect`

Restores the process list saved by `pm3 save` and starts all processes.

```bash
pm3 resurrect
```

You can also run this manually to restore your processes without rebooting.

## Removing Boot Service

```bash
pm3 unstartup
```

This removes the system service file. Your processes will no longer start on boot.

## Verifying It Works

After setting up:

1. Run `pm3 save` to save your current state.
2. Run `pm3 startup` to install the service.
3. Reboot your machine.
4. After reboot, run `pm3 list` to verify processes are running.

If processes aren't running after reboot:

- Check that `pm3 save` was run after your last config change.
- On Linux, ensure systemd lingering is enabled: `loginctl enable-linger $USER`.
- Try `pm3 resurrect` manually to see if there are errors.

## Typical Workflow

```bash
# Initial setup
pm3 start
pm3 save
pm3 startup

# After changing pm3.toml
pm3 restart
pm3 save

# To disable auto-start
pm3 unstartup
```
