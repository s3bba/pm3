pm3 captures all process output into log files and provides tools for viewing, tailing, and managing them.

## Log Files

Each process gets two log files:

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `<name>-out.log` | Standard output (stdout) |
| `<name>-err.log` | Standard error (stderr) |

Log files are stored in `~/.local/share/pm3/logs/`.

## PTY Support

pm3 uses a PTY (pseudo-terminal) for child process stdout. This preserves line-buffered output behavior, ensuring logs appear immediately rather than being delayed by output buffering. Each line is flushed to disk immediately for real-time visibility.

## Viewing Logs

### Default (last 15 lines)

```bash
pm3 log web
```

### Custom line count

```bash
pm3 log web --lines 50
```

### Follow mode

```bash
pm3 log web -f
```

Streams new log lines in real-time, similar to `tail -f`. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

## Clearing Logs

```bash
pm3 flush          # Clear all process logs
pm3 flush web api  # Clear specific process logs
```

## Log Rotation

pm3 automatically rotates log files:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Max file size | 10 MB |
| Rotated files kept | 3 |

When a log file exceeds 10MB, it's rotated and up to 3 old files are kept.

## Timestamp Formatting

Customize log timestamps with the `log_date_format` option using strftime format strings:

```toml
[web]
command = "node server.js"
log_date_format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
```

Common format specifiers:

| Specifier | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `%Y` | `2025` | Four-digit year |
| `%m` | `03` | Two-digit month |
| `%d` | `15` | Two-digit day |
| `%H` | `14` | 24-hour hour |
| `%M` | `30` | Minute |
| `%S` | `45` | Second |
| `%T` | `14:30:45` | Equivalent to `%H:%M:%S` |
| `%F` | `2025-03-15` | Equivalent to `%Y-%m-%d` |
